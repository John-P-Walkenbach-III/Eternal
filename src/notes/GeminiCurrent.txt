Project Status & Session Summary
We have successfully evolved the "Eternal Life Ministry" application from a basic structure to a robust, user-centric platform.

Key Features Implemented:

User Authentication & Progress Tracking: Implemented a full Bible study course where users can log in, take quizzes, and save their scores to a personal progress document in Firestore.
Central User Dashboard: Built a dedicated /dashboard page that serves as the main hub for logged-in users, showing a welcome message, a Verse of the Day, and a summary of their course progress.
Smart "Continue Studying" Button: Enhanced the dashboard with an intelligent button that directs users to the exact page containing their next uncompleted lesson.
Major Code Refactor (DRY): To eliminate redundant code, we created a reusable useUserProgress custom hook, which now cleanly provides all progress data to both the Dashboard and BibleStudy components.
Successful Firebase Deployment: We bypassed the paid "Blaze" plan requirement by using a targeted deployment command (firebase deploy --only hosting), getting the live site up and running for free.
Significant UI/UX Improvements:
Refined the Home page to clearly communicate the value of signing up to new visitors.
Personalized welcome messages on the Home page and Dashboard with the user's display name.
