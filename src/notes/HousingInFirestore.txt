Here is a step-by-step guide to modify your code to load data from Firestore.

Step 1: Create a Firestore Collection for Housing Resources
First, you need to create a Firestore collection to store the housing resources data. Here's how:

Go to your Firebase Console and click on Firestore Database in the left-hand menu.

Click + Start collection.

For the Collection ID, enter housingResources. Click Next.

Now, click Auto-ID to create the first document. Each document will represent one housing resource.

Add the following fields for each document, using appropriate data types and sample values:

Field: name | Type: string | Value: The name of the organization (e.g., "A New Leaf Housing And Shelter")
Field: description | Type: string | Value: A brief description of the services (e.g., "Provides housing and shelter...")
Field: website | Type: string | Value: The URL of the organization's website (e.g., "https://turnanewleaf.org")
Field: phone | Type: string | Value: The phone number of the organization (e.g., "(877) 211-8661")
Click Save to create the document.

Repeat steps 4-6 to add more housing resources to the collection. Each document should have the same fields.
